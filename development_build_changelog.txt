Changelog since last major release

5.0.3       Released 3-Mar-2024

5.0.3.1     popup_get_text - setting focus so that the window focuses immediate and the cursor goes to the input. Something about modal wasn't doing this.
5.0.3.2     execute_restart - changed how the restart is executed.  Now uses the execute python call and works corectly. execute_restart(__file__) is a handy pattern
