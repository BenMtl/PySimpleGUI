Changelog since last major release

5.0.3       Released 3-Mar-2024

5.0.3.1     popup_get_text - setting focus so that the window focuses immediate and the cursor goes to the input. Something about modal wasn't doing this.
5.0.3.2     execute_restart - changed how the restart is executed.  Now uses the execute python call and works corectly. execute_restart(__file__) is a handy pattern
5.0.3.3     changed "development build" to "maintanence release"... documenation changes underway to match.
5.0.3.4     fixed key error message
5.0.3.5     Changed Sign Up to Register.  Added Paste button to help paste keys.  
5.0.3.6     Switched away from subscription service   
5.0.3.7     Added new license (ver 1.1) to the release package so that it's installed with the PySimpleGUI module   
5.0.3.8     Fixed bug in license display in Home Window
