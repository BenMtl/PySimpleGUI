Changelog since last major release

5.0.8       Released 06-Jan-2025

5.0.8.1     User Setting API - if attempting to read the global PSG settings file and it's empty, print an error rather than attempting to display an error window
5.0.8.2     Fix in Input.update for crash when using one of the "system default" themes. Was trying to set foreground color to magic number COLOR_SYSTEM_DEFAULT
            Added new functions to set a widget's foreground and background colors... first step in a major refactor
            Added protection against recursive errors to the popup error with traceback function which caused problems if error creating a window
            Maybe fixed (or maybe created) a bug in Input.update. Was setting foreground color when switching to enabled but not the background. Added setting background color
5.0.8.3     Added import of ssl and a line of code to fix error we're seeing on the Mac
