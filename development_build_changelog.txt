Changelog since last major release

5.0.5.1      Made the Window member variable right_click_menu_element a property so that it'll show up in the call reference documentation
5.0.5.2      Changed several docstrings that had type "enum" for parms like SELECT_MODE. They were "enum" and were changed to "str"
                The reason for the change - PyCharm is highlighting those parms with a warning
