Changelog since last major release

5.0.7       Released 20-Oct-2024

5.0.7.1     Added ability to indicate no emoji should be used in error popup. Needed so that recursive error calls aren't made from image element error

5.0.7.3     Support for Python 3.14 Alpha
5.0.7.4     Swapped Window method in start_thread as the main definition and perform_long_operation as the alias for easier understanding
5.0.7.5     New command line options:
            versionnogui - prints versions numbers on the command line without creating any windows
            upgrade nogui - prints the maint releases available without making nay windows
            upgrade nogui x.x.x.x - upgrades to maint release specified by x.x.x.x without making nay windows
5.0.7.6     Added new command line function to the __main__ when building a release... hopefully this will work...
5.0.7.7     Added specific version number optional parm to the psgupgrade command to make specific maint release installs easier
5.0.7.8     Fixed typo in specifying "versionnogui" on the command line. Changed to using just "version":   python -m PySimpleGUI version
